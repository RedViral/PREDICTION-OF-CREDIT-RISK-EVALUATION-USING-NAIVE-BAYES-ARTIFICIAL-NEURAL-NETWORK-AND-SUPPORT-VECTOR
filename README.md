# PREDICTION-OF-CREDIT-RISK-EVALUATION-USING-NAIVE-BAYES-ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORK-AND-SUPPORT-VECTOR
An accurate prediction of credit risk evaluation is very useful for the banking and financial industry in minimizing the risk in lending credit to the customer and decreasing the chances of making wrong decision. As the increase in customers and emergence of different trade, it is difficult for bank management to analyze individual physically hence data mining algorithms are implemented in order to reduce the work effort by the bank management. This study attempted to implement three data mining model and compared their performances in predicting the risk in giving credit to the customer. In this study neural network based on back propagation, naive Bayes algorithm and support vector machine were implemented. Eight technical indicators were used as input for the above models. Data preprocessing were done to increase the performance of their prediction. A comparative analysis of the models was carried out and experimental results showed that the performance of Support Vector Machine (92%) was higher than the other two. Na√Øve Bayes (87%) performance was found little better than that of Artificial Neural Network (85%). Findings from this study can help in improvement of the existing system.
